he works described below.

ise any party to rebroadcast its content by any means.

y broadcasts ("Sky programming"), found through the following URL(s)/Channe=

penalty of perjury, that our client is the owner, or authorised to act on b=

is is a serious matter causing, or likely to cause, significant loss to our=

ch infringing and unlawful activity.
